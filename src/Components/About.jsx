        <p className="paragraph1">I am currently a student in the UConn Coding Boot Camp, and my career goal is to become a Full Stack Web Developer.  I am excited to learn all about Web Development, as it will allow me to be both creative and analytical.  I have a Bachelor's Degree in Business Administration from Texas Tech University, and most recently I worked as a Therapeutic Recreation Director in long-term care.</p>
        <p>Currently I live in Torrington, CT with my husband and toddler son, Owen.  In my free time I enjoy making jewelry and crafts and teaching jewelry-making classes to people of all ages.</p>
